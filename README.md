myKamus is An open source instant translation software for Indonesian that provides the user
with complex Indonesian-English translation capabilities.

To run the program you cna either do it from inside an IDE of your choice, or with Python installed either:

    a) Run clipboard_monitor through IDLE
    
    b) Launch a Powershell session through the directory and run clipboard_monitor through it

It utilises several open source bitext corpus to provide access to over 50 million example sentences and words for
the purposes of translation.

The program is free to use for academic and non-commercial applicaitons, if you wish to use it for something else
email me at gabrielcbarnett@gmail.com. There will be no cost involved, it is so we can discuss any needs you might have
for updates, specific vocabulary or language requirements. Again, it will be free but a representative from your
organisation must make contact with me first.

If you like this program and have found it useful for your work, feel free to email with your success story or any
improvements that you might suggest.

Instructions: 

myKamus is a simple console application (for now) that auto searches a copied word in a large database of Indonesian
words and sentences that have been sourced from various open-source online projects. The use of this program is very simple. 

1: Open the file named myKamus_initialise.py ensuring you have the necessary dependencies installed.

2: Highlight an Indonesian word or short phrase and copy it (ctrl+c)

3: Watch your translations come up in real time, if there are no sentences or word translations then the word may be too unique 
or niche to search. If this happens the recomendation is to search sub strings within the Indonesian word itself. Ensure that you 
have not copied any spaces around single words or phrases

4: If you would like to search for a specific word click on the console and press "ctrl+s" and then type in your desired word or phrase.

5: If you would like to load the rest of the example sentences you may press the letter "l" in the console, this may bring 
up many hundreds of thousands of resutls though depending on the simplicity and rarity of the word.
